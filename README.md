# Particle-in-a-Square-Well
Here, we enumerate and graph any number of unique eigenvalues we want for a particle in a square well. The code will also identify any degeneracies and group them together. 

Simply input the number of unique eigenvalues you want, the side-length of the square (in Bohrs), and the mass of the particle (in atomic units).
